<h3>Overview of this project:</h3>
Payment processing has become so advanced these days that customers swipe their cards and before they know it, the transaction is complete. A fraud detection algorithm should be able to detect fraudulent transactions with good accuracy. The dataset was adopted from Kaggle, which contains transactions made by European credit cards holders within a two-day period in September 2013. 99.82% of data are non-fraudulent transactions. F1 score, accuracy and false positive rate have been used to compare performance between machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees and Random Forest. Random Forest outperforms the rest with testing accuracy of 99.87%. The chosen model has the least False Positives (362) and False Negatives (3).
